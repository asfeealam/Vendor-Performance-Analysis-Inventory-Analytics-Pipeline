# Vendor Performance Analysis & Inventory Analytics

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end data analytics pipeline to evaluate vendor performance and inventory trends using **Python and SQL**. The analysis supports data-driven supplier evaluation by combining scalable data ingestion, exploratory analysis, and statistical testing.

## Objectives
- Build a scalable ingestion pipeline for large CSV datasets
- Store and query data using a relational SQL database
- Analyze vendor sales and inventory performance
- Compare vendor outcomes using statistical methods
- Enable repeatable and reliable analytics workflows

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), t-tests, SQL aggregations

## Key Features
- Chunk-based data ingestion for scalable processing
- SQL-driven data extraction and aggregation
- Python-based EDA and statistical testing
- Automated logging for data reliability
- Clear separation of ingestion, analysis, and reporting

## Results & Insights
- Identified significant differences in vendor performance using statistical testing
- Enabled structured comparison of supplier sales and inventory trends
- Created a repeatable analytics workflow suitable for production-scale datasets
